# MPL Long Poll

The MPL (MadByAd PHP Library) Long Poll is a library purposely created for providing an easy interface to implement a real time communication with HTTP Long Polling. Although HTTP Long Polling may be an outdated technique (because of WebSocket), it is easier to implement in PHP rather than Websocket, and can be used to create a seamless real time communication (though there may be slight delay in seconds)
